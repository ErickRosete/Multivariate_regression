# Multivariate_regression

Code where I tested multivariate regression methods.

The intention of this code is to be used in a robotics scenario where given a series of demonstrations 
the robot is able to predict the velocity of the pose and joint configuration to transition to the next state.

This code uses scikit-learn, auto-sklearn and MOGPTK.
